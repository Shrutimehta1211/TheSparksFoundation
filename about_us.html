                Donating is a selfless act, so giving to charity will improve our self-esteem and self-worth.<br> 
                By donating money to charity, we will achieve a greater sense of satisfaction <br>
                and growth as it feels good to help others and provide them with all the essential resources.

                 We can help them to provide reasonable safety and security to their families and children.<br>
                 A life that they can live with dignity and in their own terms.
